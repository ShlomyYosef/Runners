# Runners
This project was created for Data Science course. 

### Introduction 
The 100 metres, or 100-metre dash, is a sprint race in track and field competitions. 
The shortest common outdoor running distance, it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics. 
In our project collected more the 1000 runners seniors and young, Analzyed their data in order to understand if we can predict this. 

#### Can we predict if a runner record yet to come ?  , Did he reached his top of his game ?

### Abstract 

We collect our data from [World Athletics](https://www.worldathletics.org/) while using crawller and selenium.
The extracted data were analyzed by me and my parther, We learned alot on runners while looking at the data. 
We could see a clear relation between the age of the runner to his abilities, how must of the runners improving while been 18 to 25 
we were amazed to see that some runners set their record in a very young/old age (while looking at the outliers).
So for our questions above we looked at the runner proggress and by using Mechine Learning we could predict if the runner is going to set a new best record.
